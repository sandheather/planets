<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>A planet is a <em>celestial</em> body, orbiting a star, that is massive enough to be gravitationally <em>rounded</em> and has <q>cleared the neighbourhood</q> around its orbit.

<blockquote><q>I think of space not as the final frontier but as the next frontier.</q></blockquote>

<em>Unfortunately</em>, Pluto is no longer a planet but a dwarf planet. Sometimes I think, <em>Pluto still deserves full planet hood</em>.</p>
